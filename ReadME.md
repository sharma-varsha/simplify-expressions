# Introduction

Consider a subset of boolean filter expressions (expressed as objects) consisting of `false`, `is`, `in`, `and` filters:

The `false` filter matches nothing

Example:

```
{ type: 'false' }
```

The `is` filter matches all data points where the given attribute is the given value

Example:

```
{ type: 'is', attribute: 'country', value: 'United States' }
```

The `in` filter matches all data points where the given attribute is one of the values in the supplied list

Example:

```
{ type: 'in', attribute: 'browser', values: ['Chrome' ,'Firefox', ...] }
```

The `and` filter matches if all of the sub filters match

Example:

```
{ type: 'and', filters: [<filter>, <filter>, <filter>, ...] }
```

A filter has the following properties:
- The `type` is one of 'false', 'is', 'in', 'and'
- The `attribute` is an arbitrary string that exists for type 'is' and 'in'
- The `value` is an arbitrary string that exists for type 'is'
- The `values` is an arbitrary string that exists for type 'in'
- The order of values in `in` expression is arbitrary (same logical meaning)
- The order of filters in `and` expressions is arbitrary (same logical meaning)

A filter is said to be simpler if:
  1. it is made up of less expressions, or...
  2. it is made up of simpler expressions, `false` is simpler than `is` which is simpler than `in` which is simpler than `and`.
  3. finally an `in` filter is simpler if it has less values.


# The Challenge

Fill in the function to simplify an arbitrary boolean filter expression composed of the statements above by editing the `src/simplify.js` file.
Feel free to use any language of your choice.
Write your code as if the function will become part of a larger project.
If you do not use node.js please include instructions for running your simplify function.

Your function should:
  1. Not modify the input filter in any way - the input filter might be used somewhere else
  2. Not change the logical meaning of the filter
  3. Simplify the filter as much as possible
  4. If given a malformed filter the behavior is undefined, an error would be nice


## Running

If you have node installed you can run the tests with mocha using the following command:

```
npm install -d

node_modules/.bin/mocha test
```
